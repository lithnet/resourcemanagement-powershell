# FIM/MIM Service PowerShell Module
The Lithnet FIM/MIM Service PowerShell module is designed to make working with the FIM Service faster and easier. It abstracts away the complexity of the FIM Service and the FIMAutomation PowerShell module, and exposes a robust set of cmdlets for creating, updating, deleting and searching for resources.
